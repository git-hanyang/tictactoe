# Making a tictactoe minigame
Identify player 1 and player 2
Both players play on the same pc
Player O will have to start the game first
Each player's round end after making one move
If 3 of the same markings are aligned, the owner of these markings will be the winner
Else, the game is tied after all the tiles are marked
After that round ended, erase all the markings by pressing the reset button
